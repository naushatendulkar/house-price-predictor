# 🏠 House Price Predictor

A simple machine learning project that predicts house prices using linear regression on real-world housing data.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses the **King County housing dataset** to build a predictive model for house prices. It demonstrates a basic end-to-end ML pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
