# 🏠 House Price Predictor

A simple machine learning project that predicts house prices using linear regression on real-world housing data.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses the **King County housing dataset** to build a predictive model for house prices. It demonstrates a basic end-to-end ML pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Features of the Model

- Loads and preprocesses real-world housing data
- Encodes categorical variables (like zipcode)
- Trains a **Linear Regression** model
- Evaluates using **RMSE** and **R² score**
- Plots **Actual vs Predicted** house prices

---

## 🔢 Sample Output
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 210345.65
R² Score: 0.685

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Make sure `kc_house_data.csv` is in the same directory.
4. Run all cells or execute the script.
5. Observe the model predictions and plots.
